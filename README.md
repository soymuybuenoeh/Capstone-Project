In this repository you can find the different codes that were used for the performance of the Capstone Project. The file "Dimensiones y Subespacios" has the code required to obtain the structure of the main outputs. The files "PCA Y HORN" and "Beta Version of PCA Y HORN", are the different python files that where used to obtain the corresponding results. The beta version is just a proof of what it later on evolved into the final version of the Capstone Project code.
